# Student Web
Project for Auburn Hacks 2020

This repository is home to Student Web, a website for virtual classroom management, managed by students.

The idea came from the fact that learning management websites such as Canvas and D2L can not be modified by the student so they don't see unwanted material.

This project uses Django and bootstrap frameworks.
